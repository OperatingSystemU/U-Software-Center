U-Software-Center
=================

The software center for Operating System U. It's design will be similar to exactly like the Mint Software center but with optimizations and options to manage pacman. A major point to this is to avoid bloating. It needs to be quick and graphical like the Mint Software center. Extra features and optimizations to pacman should be consistent and similar to those in pacmanXG. Acess to installing AUR apps and advanced packages and command line apps that can be shown with a check button. Also addition of UAUR which is essentially OS u endorsing a AUR app as being GUI oriented and user friendly as well as reletivly bug free and stable.
